	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity  An Overview</h1>
	<p>
		Time complexity is a way to measure how the runtime of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases. It helps us understand the efficiency of an algorithm, especially when dealing with large inputs.

For example, an algorithm with a time complexity of O(n) means its runtime grows linearly with the input size, while an algorithm with O(log n) is usually more efficient because it grows much slower.

By analyzing time complexity, developers can compare different solutions and choose the most efficient one to ensure better performance in real-world applications.

	<b>Space Complexity</b> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm uses relative to the size of its input. It measures how efficiently an algorithm manages memory resources, which is important when working with large data or limited system memory.

For example, if an algorithm requires memory that grows directly with the size of the input, we describe it as having O(n) space complexity. This means that for every additional input element, the algorithm needs a proportional amount of extra memory.

Understanding space complexity helps in designing algorithms that balance both time efficiency and memory usage.
